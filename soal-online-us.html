The lady went home with her mouse-trap, but when she looked in her cupboard, she could not find any cheese in it. She did not want to go back to the shops, because it was very late, so she cut a picture of some cheese out of a magazine and put that in the trap.

When you have found a hotel, don't hesitate to negotiate the price. Remember that as a customer you have the bargaining power, so make use of it.6 Before making a payment, inquire about the services that are included in the room rate. Ask whether the hotel provides transportation from the airport or station. Also specity which room you want, either smoking or non-smoking7.

                                            Information will soon be so easy to find on the internet that people will not need to remember anything. Do you agree? Nowadays all the information we could ever need is available online and some people say that means the end of having to learn anything. It is true that these days everything you want to know is a few clicks away as long as you have internet access. However, not everyone has working internet all the time, for example in certain buildings or remote locations, so we do need to be able to remember information. Moreover, takes time to look up everything you need to know online, whereas remembering something is immediate. The human memory is a much more efficient system. Another problem is the quality of the information online. How do we know if it is accurate or reliable? We need to think about other facts we know and remember how to compare information from different websites. Knowing (and remembering) how to find certain information will be more important than knowing the information itself. Finally, the internet is a good tool but it is not a useful replacement for our brains. If we did not remember anything, we would all spend even more time on our phones and computers than we already do, which is not good for society. In conclusion, the internet offers us many things but it is stil important to use our knowledge and memories. We need our memories to function without the internet and we also need to know how to use the internet properly. {SOAL} TASK 1, FIND OUT 5 SENTENCES OF OPINION BASED ON THE TEXT AND WRITE ON YOUR PAPER THEN TAKE A PICTURE, FINALLY SEND IT THROUGH GOOGLE CLASSROOM.</a>
